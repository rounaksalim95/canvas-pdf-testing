# Project Overview

I want to build a web application that has a workbook which is essentially a vertically endless canvas where users can drag and drop tables. This canvas uses a pixel based layout.
The width of the canvas is that of a letter page (8.5" x 11").

Requirements:

- [x] The workbook should have a vertically endless canvas on which the user can drag and drop tables
- [x] The user can click a button to add a table to the workbook
- [x] The tables should have dummy data with 10 rows with the following columns: id, name, age, location
- [x] The table should be resizable

Please keep all styling to a minimum as we're more focused on the functionality with the most simplicity.
Please also try to keep the code as simple as possible and add comments to clearly explain the code.

# Technologies

- [x] React (with Vite)
- [x] Typescript
- [x] TailwindCSS
- [x] DND Kit for drag and drop functionality

Please try to keep things as simple as possible. If you think a library is not necessary then please don't include it.
However, use any library that you think is necessary or might make the code simpler.

# Next Steps

1. Add ability to delete tables
2. Add ability to edit table data
3. Add data persistence
4. Add more styling and polish to the UI
5. Add undo/redo functionality
6. Add export to PDF capability
