# Project Overview

I want to build a web application that includes:

An endless "workbook" canvas where users can:
- ✅ Add tables with dummy data that they can drag and drop.
- ✅ Resize those tables.
- ✅ Mark specific tables as "expanded for PDF," meaning that instead of 10 rows, they will show 50 rows only in the PDF view and not workbook view.

The workbook should use a pixel based layout.

A mechanism to export the workbook to a PDF by rendering the workbook in PDF mode when the `?pdf=true` query parameter is present in the URL.

- ✅ The PDF must be pixel perfect compared to the on-screen workbook layout.
- ✅ Handle table pagination when expanded tables don't fit on a single page
- ✅ Calculate how many rows will fit on the page
- ✅ Add pagination logic for expanded tables
- ✅ Place paginated tables at the top of new pages
- ✅ Ensure content below expanded tables flows correctly

Technologies used:
- ✅ React (with Vite)
- ✅ Typescript
- ✅ TailwindCSS
- ✅ DND Kit for drag and drop functionality
- ✅ html2pdf.js for PDF export

Completed Tasks:
- ✅ Set up project with required dependencies
- ✅ Implement basic workbook canvas
- ✅ Add table component with drag and drop
- ✅ Add table resizing functionality
- ✅ Add "expanded in PDF" toggle
- ✅ Implement basic PDF mode layout
- ✅ Implement pagination logic for expanded tables in PDF mode
- ✅ Add page calculation functionality
- ✅ Implement the ability to render a specific page in the PDF view when the `?page=n` query parameter is present
- ✅ Add PDF export functionality with html2pdf.js

Remaining Tasks:
- [ ] Test and refine PDF rendering
- [ ] Add error handling and edge cases
- [ ] Add loading states and user feedback
- [ ] Optimize performance for large workbooks
- [ ] Add documentation and usage instructions

Next Steps:
1. Test the application with various table configurations and sizes
2. Add error messages for failed PDF exports
3. Add loading indicators for table operations
4. Write documentation for the codebase
5. Add performance optimizations for large workbooks
